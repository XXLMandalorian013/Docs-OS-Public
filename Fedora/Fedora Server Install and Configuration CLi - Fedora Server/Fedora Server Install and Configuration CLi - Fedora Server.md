# Fedora Server Install and Configuration CLI - Fedora Server

_2024-01-27_

## Objective:
- Install and configure Fedora Server.

## Prerequisites/Notes:
1. This guide was done on a **Hyper-V machine**.

2. Knowledge of how to create a VM is required as it is not covered in this guide.

3. This is the **CLI guide** and not the VNC guide.

4. **LVM** is the file system by default.

## Steps:
1. Select or let it time out to "**Testâ€¦& Start this media**". This is ideal to ensure there are no errors when booting.

4. Start by addressing each section. You will know it has been addressed by changing the **!** to an **X**.
   Before clicking "**b**" to start the install, be sure to explore the "**software section**" by entering **4**.
